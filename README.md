# city-name

Concept: browse OpenStreetMap and find city names to localize into a
target-language.

Current status: loads place=* tags from OSM Overpass API, sorts them, and lets
you cycle through them.

Needs: optional update on map-move, close-up views of locations, form work, and
mobile-friendly UI.
