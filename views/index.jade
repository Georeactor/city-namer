          h4 Adding local placenames
          p Remote and foreign mappers mean well, but may use their own languages to label and define OpenStreetMap's placenames around the world.
          p When viewing a region in the project-mapper, larger cities and placenames are translated before smaller towns and neighborhoods.
          p This method can also be used to promote minority languages and create maps in different scripts.
          h4 Adding alternate placenames
          p As OpenStreetMap is used in professional, commercial, and emergency situations, it's important to have the map labels be legible by users from all over the world.
